## End to End MAchine Learning Project

Hello there, I m Vaibhav Kharatmal | Data Scientitst @Brainwonders.

We are going to discuss the most important algorithm in machine learning and deep learning Linear Regression.

What is Regression?
	Regression is a supervised learning technique that helps us find the correlation between different features and enables us to predict the output variable based on one or more predictor variables.
	The goal of regression is to predict numerical values accurately.
What is a Linear Regression?
	Linear Regression takes a group of random variables for predicting Y and tries to find a relationship between them. This relationship is typically in the form of a straight line (linear regression) that best approximates all the individual data points.
"In Linear Regression Our Main Task is to find the best fitted line"
